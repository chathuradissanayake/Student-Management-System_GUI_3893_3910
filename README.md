ðŸŽ“ðŸ–¥ Excited to announce the completion of our latest project - a comprehensive Student Management System featuring a sleek Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using C# and XAML within the WPF framework!

ðŸ”’ With a focus on security, our system incorporates authorization for both administrators and users, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

ðŸ”„ Following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, our solution offers seamless navigation and efficient data management, allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both students and administrators.

ðŸ›  Leveraging the power of SQLite database facilitated by DbBrowser, we've ensured scalability and robustness in handling vast amounts of student and administrative data.

ðŸ‘¥ This project was made possible through the collaborative efforts of Sheranga Dias and Bimsara, combining our expertise in software development and UI design to create a user-friendly and intuitive system.
